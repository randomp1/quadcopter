Notes

DMP is digital motion processing - what the sensor does to convert raw data into something more useful
(e.g. integrate angular velocity from from gyroscopes into angles)
unint8_t is an unsigned 8 bit integer
FIFO buffer - first in/first out buffer stored on Arduino

What does F do here:
Serial.println(F("\nSend any character to begin DMP programming and demo: "));

Read up on mpuIntStatus

The sensor contains its own interrupt status and its own FIFO buffer. The Arduino has to copy these across; the sensor's interrupt routine
only sets a flag on the Arduino.

Note some dmp functions actually sent programs to the sensor to activate its own DMP routine
Others do not involve the sensor at all, but process data that's already been through the sensor's DMP further

There is a possiblity that more than one data packet could be sent per interrupt
